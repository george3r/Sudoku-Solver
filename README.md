# Sudoku-Solver
Simple sudoku solver written as the capstone project for the 2020 Complete Python Bootcamp: From Zero to Hero course. 
This solver only uses the Sole Canidate and Unique Canidate methods to solve sudoku puzzles. This allows for up to intermediate level puzzles to be solved.
Block and Column/Row Interactions, Block/Block Interactions, Naked Subsets, Hidden Subsets, X-wing, and Swordfish methods are not used to solve puzzles!

If a puzzle that requires these more advanced methods is entered, the solver will solve as far as it can and then return the possible answers as a list in each cell. 
Up, down, and enter can be used to navigate the GUI when entering the initial puzzle.
